# SSD1306 GFX Lite

This is a tiny graphics driver library for Adafruit SSD1306 
monochrome OLED displays (128x64) to be used over hardware SPI. 
It stores the screen buffer, sets a pixel, or clears the screen. 

This library only requires 1264 bytes of flash on top of the basic 
minimum!

Based off of Adafruit's provided libraries. Tidied up by Alice Wang.
